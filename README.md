# Data Visualization Dashboard

This is a full-stack data visualization dashboard built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Atlas (which was eventually not successful as it was being used for deployment purposes). It fetches data from MongoDB and presents it in a user-friendly format.
